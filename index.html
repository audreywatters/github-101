<a id="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What is GitHub?</h3>

<p><a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a> is a Web-based code repository service, based on Git, a distributed revision control system. Git was first developed by Linux creator Linus Torvalds, as a way to manage the development of the open source project.</p>

<p>There are several key features to Git that make it a useful tool for collaborative projects, and although it&#8217;s most often used for managing coding, it can be used for managing other files &#8211; from Word documents to HTML pages. Unlike other version control software, Git is distributed &#8211; that means that you don&#8217;t make changes directly to a centralized repository. Instead, you work on your own local copy of the entire repo. When you&#8217;re ready (and if you choose), you can submit your changes back to the original repo. </p>

<p>GitHub offers Git's functionality, with additional features like bug reports and "social" interactions. (Whee. "Social coding.")</p>
  
<p>Git is a command line tool. You can use GitHub via the command line too, but it has a Web-based graphical interface. There are also <a href="https://windows.github.com/">Windows</a> and <a href="https://mac.github.com/">Mac</a> apps you can download.</p>

        <p>While Git is an open source tool, GitHub is a for-profit hosting platform. While it's seen steady adoption around the tech industry (and even in government), the company has been <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/03/15/julie-ann-horvath-describes-sexism-and-intimidation-behind-her-github-exit/">accused</a> of being a hostile work environment for women. GitHub has raised <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/github">$350 million</a> in venture capital from Sequoia Capital, Andreessen Horowitz, and others.</p>

<h3>
<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Vocabulary (and Functionality) of GitHub</h3>

<p>There are three major terms you need to know to understand GitHub: 1) fork, 2) pull request, 3) merge.</p>

<p>To &#8220;<strong>fork</strong>&#8221; a repository means that you copy it from one user&#8217;s account to your own. This makes it possible for you to take a project that you aren&#8217;t explicitly a member of and don&#8217;t have &#8220;write&#8221; access to, and lets you make changes on your version. <em>These changes only exist on your version; the original is not modified</em>. If you want these changes to be incorporated back into the original repo, you can send a notification called a &#8220;<strong>pull request</strong>&#8221; back to its owner. That person can review the changes you&#8217;ve made and decide whether or not to incorporate the changes in your repo into the original one &#8211; that&#8217;s a &#8220;<strong>merge</strong>.&#8221; </p>

        <p><a href="https://github.com/audreywatters/github-101">Fork this repository</a>. Make changes. Add resources to this brach. Add a question to the <a href="https://github.com/audreywatters/github-101/blob/master/digpedlab.md">digpedlab.md file in the master brach</a>. Submit a pull request.</p>
        
<h3>
<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Using GitHub Pages</h3>

<p>Each repository can generate a website automatically, using GitHub Pages. The files are hosted by GitHub and are kept inside the repository (the files are not part of the &#8220;master&#8221; branch, but one labeled &#8220;gh-pages.&#8221;) You can map the site to a custom domain. Otherwise the URL for a project&#8217;s GitHub Page will be username.github.io/projectname.</p>

        <p>While GitHub Pages do support HTML, they are powered by <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, an open source program that creates static Web pages ready to be served by Apache. </p>

  <p>This is how I power my websites. I love it because, unlike WordPress, I don't have to worry about managing a database. It's all a matter of editing Jekyll, Markdown, or HTML. My sites use the <a href="https://github.com/dirkfabisch/mediator">Mediator theme</a>. I often use <a href="http://prose.io"></a>Prose.io</a> editor to create and update files when online; for offline work, I use the <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text editor</a> (it's not free, but I'm happy to pay for software, particularly when it doesn't suck).</p>
